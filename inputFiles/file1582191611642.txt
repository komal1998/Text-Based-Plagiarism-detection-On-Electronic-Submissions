However, support for all the older versions is estimated to end by 2020. In addition, JDK 11 is the one which has been planned to get the long term support provided by Oracle. Java 9 It was released in September 2017 making significant changes along with necessary updates to Java 8. The most important update amidst them is considered to be the new architecture along with a different structure to Java. It makes use of a modular structure rather than making use of the traditional model. The advantage of modularity is the ability in setting up customized configurations of various modules and removal of any unnecessary modules. That could greatly increase the efficiency along with the scalability in various apps built over Java. The eventual goal of modularity push is to make Java more approachable to smaller-scale machines, particularly smartphones. Second, the most important improvement is the function of JShell Read-Eval-Print-Loop. Moreover, developers are able to now get immediate feedback on how the code is working. For getting more knowledge in Java join FITA, best Java Training Institute in Chennai. Java 10 Its release happened in March 2018 not more than six months after the launch of Java 9. It didnt make any crucial change but was helpful for some basic issues to be fixed. And the very crucial feature was the inclusion of new garbage interface for its collection in Java 10, which organizes and also concentrates source code for the collection of the collection into a single place instead of scattered the files and patching throughout the environment. This new version of Java also made inferences about the variable type when the developer makes use of the var keyword. Java 11 This is the latest version that has been released this year in the month of September, which marks the deadline of a monumental shift in the Java ecosystem. Some of the preplanned updates included in this are standard browser updates along with upgrading the Java to Unicode 10, which was previously making use of Unicode 8. Java 11 will definitely help the developers to get rid of the support for Java EE along with the COBRA modules. Since the new long-term release of support for Java 11 it has been considered as a standardized improvement from the previous versions such as Java 9 and 10, which applies to the customers with commercial support from Oracle. In addition, public updates related to Java 11 will come to end after a period of six months when the next version Java 12 will be released into the market. JDK 11 is elegant light on the things that modify the way of coding by developers. Some of the new trends in the market for JDK 11 are listed below: JDK 11 new string methodology Pattern with predicate utility methods is Empty Files utility method Epsilon garbage collector Time unit convert Latest Frameworks Of Java Virtual Machine There are so many virtual machine languages for java like Clojure, Groovy, JRuby, Jython, Kotlin, and Scala. These languages have been evolving in the software industry for a relatively long time and let us have a look at the new JVM languages as of 2019. JVM is the virtual language of java which is designed for the java machines and it changes the java code into byte code. Join the best Java Training to know about the multiple perspectives of a programming language like JVM, JDK, and JRE. Java programmers are using these JVM languages for the development due to certain positives. The advantages of JVM over java are in JVM the functions are used as parameters; high-level complicated functions are easily handled with the parameterization, case matching and compact code, and the functions of the compiler. Join Java Training in Porur to be confident in the multiple concepts in the language. Programmers use primary languages and secondary languages in their coding and make their builds as an efficient one. The knowledge about multiple languages has become the predefined criteria for an experienced developer. Let us have a look at the Scala, Kotlin and Groovy programming language for the JVM as they are widely used. Class loader, method area, JVM language stacks, heap, native method stacks, PC registers, native method stacks, execution engine, native method interface, and native method libraries are the components which form the architecture of JVM. Join the best JAVA Training Institute in Chennai to gain the knowledge from the expert trainers from the scratch to the advanced level. Scala Scala was introduced to the industry in the year 2008 by the Martin Odersky. Scala is largely used in the data science projects and it is written to target the Java virtual machine. Scala developers do not have the need to learn the other programming languages but due to the announcement from Google for the spring and Google, the Scala is now replaced for the Kotlin. Some of the features of Scala were introduced in Lambdas and Stream. Scala is a very good language to learn for the Java developers. Play, AKKA, and spark are the popular frameworks of the Scala. Learning a new language boost the knowledge about the different data structure, coding designs, different types of the algorithm, and different approaches to the problem. So learning new languages like Scala will help the programmers to write code better, read the better code, debug code and run the code quickly. Java Training with the Best Java Training Institute in Chennai makes your bio-data with high priority due to the programming language knowledge. Many giant companies like Uber, Sony, Amazon, and Autodesk are using the Scala language to enhance customer satisfaction with a wide range of reachable services. Scala is the perfect blend of the functional programming and the object-oriented programming. The parts of java language where some restrictions are levied are unleashed in the Scala language which increases the productivity. Some of the good features in the Scala language is immutable data structures with no effects on the environment, the simple one-liner language with less punctuation, short syntax, condensing map and filter, and finally, the code will support both the multiple inheritances and different types of capabilities. Kotlin In the year 2011, JVM language Kotlin was introduced and this is the official language for the Android development. The announcement regarding kotlin was made by Google in the year 2017. Kotlin is the language alternatively used for Java and it is the official language for android. Kotlin was designed by the company called Jet brains and it is used as an open source platform by the programmers. The simplicity in the language made this language as a popular language. For instance fun keywords are used in the Kotlin, semicolons which are mandatory in the java are optional in the Kotlin language. The keywords and ranges are well used in the Kotlin language. Java Classes in Chennai offers the training to make the learning curve flat from the upsurge. Functional programming and object-oriented programming are two different concepts in the programming world. In functional programming functions cannot be stored in objects and in object-oriented programming, the programming is based on objects. For the programs which can be divided into smaller parts, object-oriented programs yield better results. Join the Best JAVA Training in Chennai and become a professional with high salary package in the industry. When converting the java program into kotlin it is clearly known that kotlin is handy language it supports the object-oriented nature of java. The other classes inherit with the keywords in the Kotlin classes whereas in the case of Java the final keyword is marked as inheritable. In the case of overriding the methods are marked as open and the subclass is marked as an override. The Kotlin makes the things explicit and it is not operated with the default operations. JAVA Training in Chennai is for the beginners and experienced with ample interest into the coding. The checked exceptions in Java are lacking in the kotlin. The expenditure on using Java and kotlin is the same. The java set only properties are easily fixed in the Kotlin. Some of the new things in kotlin for the Java developers in Kotlin are the extension functions, support functional programming and add coroutines. Java Training in T.Nagar is the best place for learning and understanding the difference between the multiple programming languages. There are similarities in between Scala and Kotlin like the notations like immutable declarations using va1, mutable declarations using var, narrow in the declaration of lambda function, and the usage of a single arrow and double arrow. The getters and setters are available in a java class and calling the java code from the kotlin language work well in the applications. These features are common in Java and kotlin and the name for getter and setter in Kotlin is properties.

Expectations with JDK 13 JDK is expected in the year 2019 with many attributes and the developers are focused towards quality before the release. The multiple lines of source code are covered by raw string and it is the new attribute expected from the JDK 13. Rawstring is a literal with string in which the escaping rules are eliminated and everything is literal or direct. This is the feature which is expected with the JDK 12 and it is postponed to JDK 13. The characters with the sequence are described without java indicators and these strings are focused towards grammar apart from Java. After the testing process the new attributes are added to the JDK 13 with the quality in the production. JDK 14 is expected with high quality with the raw string after its first release. Let us take a look at how the raw string makes the functions of java simpler. Join the Java Training in Chennai at FITA to explore the new trends in Java the legendary technology. Simplification is the most needed part in the programming language which derived through the library and the JDK code. Simple codes and readable codes are enhanced for the back end support to optimize the performance. The feature of multi-line raw string is available in many other languages like Groovy, Java script and Python for the enhancement of the performance. This reduces the usage of the java escapes and the java line terminator for keeping the character sequence readable with the code. The concept of string interpolation is not added to the raw string and in future it is expected to take part in the raw string. Some of the advantages of these strings are already added in the RSL and some are not added. The enhancements can be with the line support, trim, and margin management and escape management by using raw string. Beta implementation is added in the JDK and switch expressions is added which help for the behavior with control over the flow. This helps for the blocking of calls, synchronous and makes the blocking as free.Java Course in Chennai at FITA is conducted with veteran trainers who are from the top software companies with good record of performance. Pending releases of Java Project loom is the other feature which is not added to the Java fully and this helps for optimizing the performance with the simple abstraction and leaves less number of footprints. This manages the threads efficiently and it introduces the fibers as light weight with the usage of JVM. The memory and the task switching with the fibers are almost close to zero.The ultimate need of this is to add the light weight thread to the java eco system. The java program is designed to use the threads easily and the primitives are synchronized with this. If there is mismatch in the orders then it is difficult to handle for the server. Integration with the other language and integration with the code is one of the important functions which API should have. Many asynchronous API are created in the Java ecosystem to handle the integration part in Java.It helps to run the existing code and reduces the time also. the REST service or servlet takes more time when compared to this. Records This feature help for POJO class and it makes the coding part with this easier.Java Training in Chennai is highly demanded as many projects are based out of java. Future of Java Java is used for the web development, mobile development and the desktop development. Cross platform mobile apps are developed using the java platform with the help of SDK. Java standard libraries, Maven, JHipster, Guava, apache commons, hibernate-ORM, Junit, Mockito, log4j, google-gson, and SIf4j are the wide range of libraries available in java for the making the complex part in the coding easy.There are troubles in moving from the versions like the 8 to 12 or 11. The version change is a problem in the software industry with respect to the investment and it demands to change the whole functionalities. Simplification for the container management and the version change are given more importance when thinking about the future of Java. Competition with JVM is initialized by the other languages like the kotlin and scala. Learn Java Course in Chennai to enter in to the vast industry as many other technologies need java background. Powerful languages are needed to empower the emerging technologies like Artificial intelligence and machine learning and thus Java is demanded to build the complicated large systems.

This was considered a treasure due to its wide usage on any platform or architecture. Java Training in Chennai at FITA provides a solid platform to launch your career in Java. Java is one of the popular programming languages that are class-based and object-oriented. Java is owned by Oracle company and its functioning in 3 billion devices around the world. Java will be safe for many years with high demand for Java developers in top MNC. Java is developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and was launched in 1995. It is now acquired by Oracle Corporation. This language has similar syntax from C and C++. Here we discuss the features of Java programming in brief as listed below 1, Java is a platform-independent programming language 2, Java is an Object-oriented language 3, Java is very fast to use 4, Java provides features for security 5, Java is a huge standard library The latest edition of Java programming is Java SE 8. Many configurations built to suit different platforms. The new version J2 is called Java SE, Java EE and Java ME accordingly. Here we require a Pentium 200 MHz computer with RAM of 64 MB. The following software required for these is Windows XP or Win 7 or Win 8 or Linux 7.1, Java JDK 8, Microsoft Notepad or any text editor. The basic concepts followed in Java are Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Classes, Objects, Instance, Method. James Gosling introduced Java in June 1991which was known as Oak named after an oak tree outside Gosling's office and got its name changed as of Java over a period. Thus, the journey of Oak becoming to be known as Java ends here. Java Training in velachery was not an open-source initially, it was under the influence of GNU General Public License, and Sun released the open-source version of Java in November 2006. Also, by May 2007 it was completely coded free language. The evolution of Java till date is listed below: JDK Beta (1995) JDK 1.0 (Jan 1996) JDK 1.1 (Feb 1997) J2SE 1.2 (Dec 1998) J2SE 1.3 ( May 2000) J2SE 1.4 (Feb 2002) J2SE 5.0(Sep 2004) Java SE 6 (Dec 2006) Java SE 7(July 2011) Java SE 8 (Mar 2014) Java SE 9(Sep 2017) Java SE 10(Mar 2018) Java SE 11(Sep 2018) Java SE 12 (Mar 2019) Tomcat is considered the desirable application server for the open-source programming language-Java. For the usage of Java in any web browser, it is necessary to have a Java plug-in. Java has unlocked its doors for interaction with other companies to extend the Java community. With the back-to-back, the release of versions in Java its expectation for lots of changes shortly. Thus, Java Training is very popular in the market to become successful as a programmer. FITA is ranked as the best Java Training Institute in Chennai. Java Training in Chennai- Outline There are various training for plenty of programming languages present in the market but Java remains at the top of the list. Sun Microsystems developed it in the year 1995. James Gosling is the one behind its innovation. The recent update released by them for Java is Java SE 11(18.9 LTS) launched in September 2018. Pattern with Predicate Utility Methods, Optional.isEmpty, Epsilon Garbage Collector are some of the noted features of Java SE 11. Soon after the launch of Java, its popularity made openings for multiple configurations for different platforms like J2EE, J2ME and the list continues. Its preference amidst developers keeps on increasing as program once written in Java Training in Chennai can be executed irrespective of the platform it is implemented. How is Java related to C and C++ The syntax of Java Course is derived from C and the object model is derived from C++. The programmers who are well versed with C/C++ language will be easily learning Java. Moreover, Java developers do not create a new thing but modify the already existing. As many similarities are prevailing between Java and C++, Java is known as the Internet version of C++. Java was not created for the replacement of C++ whereas its creation is to support for getting solution issues, which arise in C++. Hence, Java Course in Chennai is preferred over others. How is Java related to C# C# language was developed by Microsoft, which has similar features with Java. Both of them are using the general style syntax. FITA is considered as the best Java Training Institute in Chennai. Contribution of Java to the Internet Applet An Applet is one of the contributions of Java, which reframed the networked program across the world. It is designed for transmission over the Internet and executed by the web browser, which is compatible with Java. If the user clicks on anything, which consists of Applet, then it will download the applet automatically. Applet runs within a web browser, which works at the client-side. It is embedded in an HTML page with the use of OBJECT or APPLET tag. Points to remember: Every applet is a sub-classes of java.applet.Applet class. They have never been a stand-alone program as they run inside an applet viewer or a web browser. Moreover, JDK enables a standard viewing tool for an applet namely applet viewer. For an applet window, the output is not done using System.out.println() whereas done using AWT methodologies. The execution of the applet at the main() method is not used in the beginning. The various methods are: init(): This is the first method that is called for the initialization of variables. Moreover, it is called only once during run time. start(): It is the next step after init() and also called to restart an applet once it is stopped. paint(): The paint( ) is called every time AWT-based output of an applet needs to be redrawn, which can occur for many reasons. For instance, the window where the applet is running may be overwritten by another window. Or else even the applet window might be minimized and later on restored. In another instance, it is also called when the execution of the applet begins. stop(): This method is called when an HTML document having is left by the web browser. When stop( )is called, the applet is under execution. destroy(): This is called when the environment is the key factor in determining which applet is needed to be removed completely from memory. Features of Applets over HTML It displays dynamic web pages of any web application. It plays sound files. Plays animations Displays various documents It made numerous changes in the world of the Internet as the objects were able to progress freely. The 2 categories of information that are transmitted between the server and client namely passive and dynamic information. Let us get into the topic of what makes Java more prominent Complex-free: Java was designed for the developers to write programs with ease. It is considered easier than C++ as there is an automatic memory allocated. Multi-threaded: The capacity of a program to perform many tasks simultaneously within the program. Object-Oriented: Allows the user in the creation of modular programs along with reusable code. Distributed: Designed to make allocated computing simple along with the networking capability. Platform-Independent: Moving it from one system to another can be done with much ease. Secure: The Java language is highly secured when compared with other programming languages. Robust: It helps in eliminating error due to the presence of time error check along with runtime check. StackAllocation: This helps the user to store data with ease. High Performance: Java set up high performance due to the presence of just-in-time compilers. Thus, enroll yourself in Java Training at FITA for a blissful future. History of Java The project Java was initiated in the year 1991 by James Gosling, which was originally called Oak named after the Oaktree, which stood in the entrance of James's office. Then it was renamed as Green and after a long time, it got the name Java'. Its public implementation happened in the year of 1995 by Sun Microsoft. After this, it was made open source in the year 2006under the terms of GPL. Finally, on May 8th of 2007, the process of making it code free was accomplished. Java Classes in Chennai is of great opportunity for IT professionals. Tools in need There are certain specifications to be fulfilled for running Java in your system. As Java Training is fetching more students it is indeed to have the specific hardware and software to work on Java. They are specified below: Pentium 200-MHzComputerwith64 MB of RAM Linux 7.1 or Windows xp/7/8 operating system Java JDK 8 Microsoft Notepad Java-Syntax A program in Java is a cluster of an object, which communicates by calling upon each other's method. Let us concentrate on the various components present in Java syntax: Class- It is the blueprint, which describes the state of the object supported by it. Object- They have various states along with different behaviors. Methods- It is always been a behavior. Instance variables- Every object has a unique set of it. Java Identifiers Every component present in Java requires names. It may be used for classes, methods, and variables that are known as identifiers. There are certain basic things to be remembered: The identifier should begin with the alphabet, underscore or currency character. They are case sensitive. The rest of the characters should be a combination of characters. The keyword should not be used as an identifier. Java Modifiers It is indeed necessary to modify methods, class and other components. The modifiers are classified into two: non-access modifier: abstract, final Access modifier: public, default Java Variables There are various Java variables: Local Variables Instance Variables (Non-static Variables) Class Variables (Static Variables) Java Enums Java 5.0 consists of Enums, which restricts variables to have a single predefined value form the given list. Enums are used for the reduction of bugs in the code. Java Keywords There are certain reserved words that cannot be used as variable or constant namely: abstract, assert, Boolean,break, byte, case, catch, char, class,continue,const, default, else, double, float, final, do, enum, extends, if, for, implements, goto, int, import, interface, instance, native, long, package, new, public, short, private, return,strictfp, synchronized, throw, switch, static, transient, volatile, void, try, throws. Comments in Java It supports both single and multi-line comments, which is similar to C and C++. Inheritance The specialty of Java classes can be derived from classes. Interfaces It is the arrangement between objects for the method to communicate. It plays a crucial role in inheritance. Java  objects & Classes Java is an object-oriented language which includes: Inheritance Polymorphism Abstraction Encapsulation Objects Instance Class Object Classes present in Java There are 3 classes present in Java: A class can contain any of the following variable types. Local variables: These variables are defined inside methods, constructors or blocks. Instance variables: variables are defined within a class and outside any method. Class variables: These are declared within a class, outside the method, with the static keyword. How to Use Singleton Class? Its work is to control object creation, which in turn limits the number of objects to one. As there is a singleton instance, its occurrence will be restricted to one per class. Join our Java Classes in Chennai and get more knowledge in it. How to Create an Object A class in Java administers the blueprints for any objects. The steps involved in the creation of an object are: Declaration: A variable is declared with a variable name and an object type. Instantiation: The new' keyword is used for the creation of an object. Initialization: The new' keyword is pursued by a call to a constructor. Operators The various operators available in Java are: Bitwise Operators &(bitwise and), ~ (bitwise complement), | (bitwise or), >> (right shift), << (left shift), ^ (bitwise XOR), >>> (zero fill right shift). Arithmetic Operators + (Addition), * (Multiplication), % (Modulus),  (Subtraction), / (Division), ++ (Increment) Assignment Operators  =, *=, +=, %=, |= Logical Operators  || (logical or), && (logical and),! (logical not) Relational Operators == (equal to), < (less than), != (not equal to), <= (less than or equal to) Misc Operators-Conditional Operator Application There are over 3 billion devices, which run on Java script. Thus, joining Java Training in Chennai at FITA will be of great help for you to enter the IT sector. Few among them are listed below: Web based Applications such as amazon.in, etc. Mobile Enterprise based Applications like banking applications. Robotics Desktop-based applications like media player, acrobat reader, etc. Embedded System Smart Card Games Types Of Java Applications There are four types of applications, which can be generated with the use of Java programming: 1) Web Application An application that can be executed on the server-side along with the creation of the dynamic page is known as a web application. Servlet, Struts, JSF, Spring, etc. are some of the technologies which are used in the creation of web applications. 2) Standalone Application Standalone applications are also known as window-based or desktop applications are traditional software, which is indeed necessary to be installed on every machine. There are various examples for standalone applications such as antivirus, Media player, etc. AWT and Swing are deployed in the creation of Java. 3) Enterprise Application An application that is assigned in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called enterprise application. It has many benefits of load balancing, high-level security, and clustering. Enterprise Java Beans is deployed for the creation of enterprise applications. 4) Mobile Application An application that is created for mobile devices is known as a mobile application. These days, Java ME and Android are used for the creation of various mobile applications. Java Platforms The students with a considerable amount of knowledge in Java Training have good openings in the market. Java platforms are classified into: 1) Java Standard Edition Java SE is a Java programming platform that consists of Java programming APIs like java.net java.lang, java.io, java.math, java.util, java.sql, etc. It has basic topics such as OOPs, Reflection, Regex, Exception, String, Inner classes, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Multithreading, Swing, Collection, etc. 2) Java Enterprise Edition J2EE is an enterprise platform that is primarily used for the development of enterprise and web applications. It is erected on top of the Java SE platform. It also has topics such as Servlet, Web Services, EJB, JSP, JPA, etc. 3) Java Micro Edition JME is a micro platform that is used to develop various mobile applications. 4) JavaFX It is used to develop an affluent internet application, which makes use of light-weight user interface API. Difference Between JDK, JRE, And JVM JVM Java Virtual Machine is an abstract machine and is called a virtual machine as its existence is not physical. Moreover, it is a blueprint, which provides a runtime environment for the execution of Java bytecode. Also, the execution of programs written in other languages is possible. All three JVM, JDK, and JRE are platform reliant due to the composition of all the unique operating systems. JVMs are availability us not constrained to any one hardware or software. For further information, join FITA, the best Java Training Institute in Chennai. The tasks performed by JVM are: Supply's runtime environment Loading of code Verifying the code Execution of code What Is JVM JVM is a specification in which the working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. Moreover, the implementation provider is not dependent on the choice of the algorithm whose implementation is provided by Oracle. FITA is among the top Java Coaching Centers in Chennai. JVM describes the following: Register set Fatal error reporting Memory area Class file format Garbage-collected heap Java Variables A variable is a container that possesses the value when the java program has been executed. A variable is accredited with a datatype. Variable is a name given for memory location, which is classified into three types: instance, local, and static. Join our Core Java Training in OMR and get the opportunity to enter the It sector. There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive. Variable It is the fundamental unit of storage in any program. The value that is stored in a variable can be altered during the process of the program execution. A variable is just a name given to a memory location. In Java, every variable must be declared before bringing into use. Variable has always been a combination of vary + able. Data Types in Java Training in Chennai Data types define the different sizes, values as well, which can be stored in the variable. It is classified into two data types in Java: Primitive data types: Primitive data types consist of boolean, byte, double, short, int, char, long and float. Non-primitive data types: This include Classes, Interfaces, along with Arrays. Java Primitive Data Types In Java language, basic data types are the building blocks of data manipulation. The following are the fundamental data types that are available in the Java language. Become smart by joining our Java Training in Adyar. They are classified into 8 types of primitive data types: byte data type char data type short data type Boolean data type float data type int data type long data type double data type Boolean Data Type The Boolean data type is used for the storage of only two possible values either true or false. This data type is used for tracking of true/false conditions in simple flags. Byte Data Type The byte data type also belongs to primitive data type, which has an 8-bit signed two's complement integers. The value-range of byte datatype lies between -128 to 127 with the minimum value -128 and the maximum value 127 with a default value is 0. This is used to save memory in large arrays in which the memory savings is indeed necessary that saves space as a byte is 4 times smaller than an integer. This can be used for the replacement of the int data type. Short Data Type It is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer who's value-range lies amid -32,768 to 32,767 considering minimum value as -32,768 and the maximum value is 32,767. The default value in the short data type is also 0. It is similar to the byte data type to memory saving. Moreover, it is 2 times smaller when compared with an integer. Int Data Type This data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer with a value ranging between  2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. The minimum value is considered to be  2,147,483,648 and maximum value as 2,147,483,647 with a default value as 0. This is broadly used as the default data type for the integral values except if there is no problem for the memory. Long Data Type This is a 64-bit two's complement integer and consist of value-ranging between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Long datatype has minimum value as  9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and with the maximum value as 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. The default value is considered to be 0. This data type is deployed when there is a need for a range of values that are provided more than by int. Float Data Type This data type is a single-precision 32-bit floating point with a value range that is considered unlimited. It is favored to the usage of a float instead of using double if there is a need to save memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers. This data type should never be used for precise values such as currency with a default value as 0.0F. Double Data Type This is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point with an unlimited range of value. This data type is normally used for decimal values similar to float. The double data type should never be used for precise values, like currency with a default value of 0.0d. Java If-else Statement Java if statement is deployed to test the condition and checks the boolean condition of true or false. The types of if statement in java are: if statement if-else-if ladder if-else statement nested if statement Java if Statement It runs the if block if the condition is true. Syntax: if(condition){ //code to be executed } Java If-Else Statement The Java if-else statement executes the if block, when the condition is true otherwise else block is executed. Syntax: if(condition){ //code if the condition is true }else{ //code if the condition is false } Java Nested If Statement The nested if statement serves the if block within another if block. In this, the inner if block condition runs only when the outer if block condition is true. Java Switch Statement The Java switch statement executes only one statement from multiple conditions. The switch statement works with long, byte, short, int, enum types, String. In other words, the switch statement is deployed for testing the equality of variables against multiple values. Loops Available In Java In the various programming languages available, loops are used to execute a set of instructions repeatedly when some of the conditions are true. They are classified into three types: while loop for loop do-while loop Java For Loop In Java, for loop is used for the iteration of a part of the program many times. If the number of iterations is steady, it is recommended for the usage of the loop. They are: Labeled For Loop Simple For Loop Enhanced For Loop Java Simple For Loop A simple loop is the same as C or C++. Initialization of variable, condition check, and increment or decrement value can be done. It has four parts: Initialization: It is the initial condition that is executed when the loop begins. Here, initialization of we can initialize the variable, or we can use an already initialized variable. It is an optional condition. Condition: It is the next condition that is executed every time to test the condition of any loop and continues the execution process until the condition is false. It must return a boolean value either true or false. Statement: The statement of the loop is executed each time until the second condition is false. Increment/Decrement: The variable value can be incremented or decremented, which is an optional condition. Java For-Each Loop The for-each loop is used to traverse collections in java. And is easier to implement than simple for a loop as there is no need to increment the value along with the use of subscript notation. It works on elements basis and not on the index. We get you trained in Java Course for a bright future. Syntax: for(Type var:array){ //code to be executed } Java Labeled For Loop We can bear the name of each Java Training in Tambaram for a loop. We can make use of labels before the for loop. It is indeed useful if we have nested for loop, with its help we can break/continue specifically for a loop. Syntax: labelname: for(initialization;condition;incr/decr){ //code to be executed } Java Infinitive For Loop If you use two semicolons ;; in the for loop, it will be infinite for loop. Syntax: for(;;){ //code to be executed } Java While Loop The Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iterations is not fixed, it is recommended to use a while loop. Syntax: while(condition){ //code to be executed } Java Infinite While Loop If you pass true in the while loop, it will be infinite while loop. Syntax: while(true){ //code to be executed } Java Do-While Loop The Java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iterations is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use the do-while loop. The Java do-while loop is run at least once because the condition is checked after the loop body. Syntax: do{ //code to be executed }while(condition); Java Infinitive Do-While Loop If you pass true in \ do-while loop, it will be an infinitive do-while loop. Syntax: do{ //code to be executed }while(true); Java Break Statement When a break statement is encountered within a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and program control resumes at the next statement following the loop. The Java break is used to break the loop or the switch statement. It breaks the current flow of the program at a specified condition. In the case of the inner loop, it breaks the inner loop alone. We can use Java break statement in all types of loops such as for loop, while loop and do-while loop. We will give training with the help of real-time examples in FITA, the best Java Training in Chennai. Syntax: jump-statement; break; Continue Statement The continue statement is used in a loop control structure when you need to jump to the next iteration of the loop immediately. It can be used with for loop or while loop. The Java continue statement is used to continue the loop. It continues the current flow of the program and skips the remaining code at a specified condition. In the case of the inner loop, it continues the inner loop. We can use Java continue statement in all the types of loops like for loop, while loop and do-while loop. For any further knowledge in Java enroll yourself in our J2EE Training in Chennai. Syntax: jump-statement; continue; Java Operators It is used to operate on variables and values. These two terms are included operand and operator. Call 98404-11333 to explore more about JAVA Training in Chennai at FITA. Example : int x=100 + 50 * Values are the operand *The operation performed between two operands is defined as an operator. FITA is the no.1 JAVA Course in Chennai Multidimensional Arrays If an array contains one or more arrays is called a multidimensional array. To create a two-dimensional array add each array to itself of curly braces. To explore more in java FITA Java classes in Chennai Example int[ ][ ] x={{1,2,3},{5,6,7}}; X is an array with two arrays with its elements To access the elements of the X array, set the two indexes: One for array and one for the elements inside that array. If you need to explore more in java FITA Java Training Example int [ ][ ] x={{1,2,3},{5,6,7}}; int y=x[1][2]; System.out.println(y); RESULT::7 We can also use for loop inside the for loop to access the elements of a two-dimensional.FITA core Java training in Chennai Example int[ ][ ] x={{1,2,3},{5,6,7}}; for(int i=0;i<x.length;++i) {for(int j=0;j<x[i].lemgth;++j) {system.out.println(x[i][j]); }} Modifier Type Modifiers are the keywords that can be added to those definitions, which are intended to be changed for their meanings. Java is a language that has a wide range of modifiers, inclusive of the following  Java Access modifiers Non Access Modifiers For making use of a modifier, keyword is included in the definition of a class, variable, or method. Java Training in Chennai will be of great scope for you. Access Control Modifiers Java has several access modifiers to set access levels for various classes, variables, methods, and constructors. There are four access levels- Those are visible to package, the default. No modifiers are required. Visible to the class alone (private). Visible to package and all the subclasses (protected). Visible to the entire world (public). Character Class We come across many situations where the need for objects is done instead of primitive data types. To achieve this, Java gives wrapper class Character for the primitive data type char. The Character class normally wraps the value of all the primitive type char into an object. Thus, an object of type Character can consist of a single field whose type is char. Java Course in Chennai is the best course for professionals who are looking for the domain change. All the fields, constructors, and methods of the class Character that are specified by the Unicode Data file and is a part of the Unicode Character Database, which is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. Java in generic makes use of the UTF-16 encoding method to represent the various char arrays in the String or String Buffer. Escape Sequences When any character is preceded by a backslash it is referred to as an escape sequence and has specific meaning to the compiler. FITA has been regarded as the best Java training institute in Chennai. String Class With the help of various methods, it is simple to perform various operations like trimming, replacing, converting, comparing, concatenating on the string. It is a powerful concept as everything is considered as a string, while the submission can be done in window, web-based or mobile-based applications. Creating Strings Whenever there is a presence of string literal in the code, the compiler enables in the creation of a String object with its value in this case for instance, Hello world!'. It is possible to create String objects by deploying any new keyword along with a constructor. The String class consists of 11 constructors that enable the user to provide the initial value for the string with the use of different sources like an array of characters. String Length Methods used to obtain information regarding an object is referred to as the accessor method, which can be used with strings is the length() method that returns the number of characters present in the string object. Date and Time Java is a proficient language that provides the Date class accessible in java.util package and this encapsulates the current date and time. Getting Current Date and Time This is a simple method to get the current date and time. You can make use of simple Date object with the use of toString() method to print the current date and time Sleeping for a While The user can sleep for any duration of time from one millisecond to the lifetime of the computer, which is an added advantage. GregorianCalendar Class This is a definite implementation of a Calendar class, which implements a normal Gregorian calendar. The getInstance( ) method of this Calendar returns a GregorianCalendar boot up with the current date along with time in default local and time zone. It defines both AD and BC fields, which represent two eras defined by the Gregorian calendar. Regular Expression Regular Expression is also known as Java Regex is an API used to define a pattern for initiating the search or manipulation of strings. This is a special sequence of characters, which aids the user to match other strings or sets of strings with the usage of a specialized syntax held in any pattern. Its usage is widely done for defining the constraint on strings like password and email validation. After gaining knowledge in Java regex, it will be simple for you to test regular expressions by deploying Java Regex Tester Tool. A java.util.regex package is provided by Java to match the pattern with regular expressions, which is similar to Pearl programming language. This package consists of three classes: Pattern Class ? This provides no public constructors. To create a pattern, the user must invoke its public static compile() methods. It is a compiled version of a regular expression. Matcher Class ? It is the engine that interprets the pattern and also performs public constructors. The user can obtain a Matcher object by just invoking the matcher() method on a Pattern object. This implements the MatchResult interface. The different methods available in the Matcher Class are: Index methods Study methods Replacement methods PatternSyntaxException ? This is an unchecked exception, which indicates a syntax error in a regular expression pattern. Capturing Groups Capturing groups are a way to treat multiple characters as a single unit. They are created by placing the characters to be grouped inside a set of parentheses. For example, the regular expression (dog) creates a single group containing the letters d, o, and g. Java  Methods It is a collection of statements, which are grouped to operate. When the user calls the System.out.println()method, the system executes several statements for displaying a message on the console. A method is nothing but a block of code that only runs when it is called by the user. The user can pass data, called parameters, into a method. Methods are deployed to perform specific actions, called as functions. Creating Method A method is needed to be declared within a class. Moreover, it is defined with the name of the method, being followed by parentheses (). Method Calling For the deployment of a method, it is indeed necessary to be called. This can be done in two different ways: method returns a value or returning nothing. To call a method in Java, the user needs to write the method's name succeeded by two parentheses () and a semicolon; The process of method calls can be done with ease. When a program invokes any method, the control of the program gets transferred to the called method, which in turn returns control to the caller in two conditions, when ? it reaches the method ending closing brace. the return statement is executed. Method Parameters The information can be passed to functions as a parameter that is specified after the method name, within the parentheses. The user can also add as many parameters as per the necessity by just separating them with a comma. The Void keyword The void keyword enables the user to create methods that do not return a value. Method Overloading When a class consists of two or more methods with the same name but different parameters, it is referred to as method overloading, which is different from overriding. In the method of overriding, a method has the same method name, type, number of parameters. Passing Parameters by Value While working concealed by the calling process, an argument is to be passed. And this should be in the same order as their corresponding parameters present in the method specification. Parameters can be passed either by value or reference. Passing the parameters by Value stands for calling a method with a parameter. Using Command-Line Argument At times the user may determine to pass few information into a program when during the execution. This is done just by passing command-line arguments to main( ). A command-line argument is a piece of information that directly precedes the program's name on the command line when it is run. To access the command-line arguments within a Java program can be done with ease. The finalize () Method It is likely to define a method that is to be called before an object's final destruction by the garbage collector. And this method is referred to as finalize( ), which can be used to ensure that an object terminates perfectly. To add a finalizer to any class, the user simply defines the finalize( ) method. Within the finalize( ) method, the user will specify actions that are to be performed before the destruction of an object. Files and I/O The java.io package contains nearly every class you might ever need to perform input and output (I/O) in Java. All these streams represent an input source and an output destination. The stream in the java.io package supports many data such as primitives, objects, localized characters, etc. Java input and output process every input and generates the output based on the given input. Java makes use of streams to perform the input and output operation. Package java.io consists of the classes that are needed for the input and output operation. A stream is a series of data. Three streams are created automatically in Java which is as follows: in: This stands for the standard input stream and gives the data to the user's program. Generally, a keyboard is used as a standard input stream. out: It stands for the standard output stream to output the data generated by the user's program and the generic monitor is used for the standard output stream. err: It stands for the standard error stream and is used to get output the error data generated by the user's program. Stream A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. There are two kinds of Streams ? InPutStream ? The InputStream is used to read data from a source. OutPutStream ? The OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination. Java provides strong but flexible support for I/O related to files and networks but this tutorial covers very basic functionality related to streams and I/O. We will see the most commonly used examples one by one ? Byte Streams Java byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. Though there are many classes related to byte streams but the most frequently used classes are, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. Character Streams Java Byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes, whereas Java Character streams are used to perform input and output for 16-bit Unicode. Though there are many classes related to character streams but the most frequently used classes are, FileReader and FileWriter. Though internally FileReader uses FileInputStream and FileWriter uses FileOutputStream but here the major difference is that FileReader reads two bytes at a time and FileWriter writes two bytes at a time. Standard Streams All the programming languages provide support for standard I/O where the user's program can take input from a keyboard and then produce an output on the computer screen. If you are aware of C or C++ programming languages, then you must be aware of three standard devices STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR. Similarly, Java provides the following three standard streams ? Standard Input ? This is used to feed the data to the user's program and usually a keyboard is used as a standard input stream and represented as in. Standard Output ? This is used to output the data produced by the user's program and usually a computer screen is used for standard output stream and represented as out. Standard Error ? This is used to output the error data produced by the user's program and usually a computer screen is used for standard error stream and represented as err. Reading And Writing Files As described earlier, a stream can be defined as a sequence of data. The InputStream is used to read data from a source and the OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination. Tip for becoming a good Java programmer Java is considered as the basic programming language for many applications around the world. Also, it is the easiest language that can be learned to enter the IT sector. When object-oriented programming is considered the first thing that strikes our mind is Java that makes the way for cross-platform programming along with the application development. Java Training in Tnagar at FITA will help aspirants to make a successful career as a Java Developer. Its popularity is due to the effortless path to perform multiple tasks related to programming. Java has been of complete utilization by the experts in the field. And for becoming an efficient developer in Java certain tips will be useful for you. Strong foundation in the basics Whatever may be the course you are learning having a thorough knowledge of basics is considered to be very important. As there is no point of getting a doubt in sentence formation when you are not thorough of the alphabet. Its human nature to learn many things and forget the basics. Thus, it leads to the stumbling of developers during the creation of critical programs in Java programming as well. Execute the gained knowledge It is usual for children watching TV or listening to music while studying these days, which leads to a shorter span of memory. Similarly, developers who just learn the concepts at one go and do not execute them will experience some sort of issue during the execution of any new program. Thus, we offer hands-on experience for almost all the topics in the class. Figure out the code and algorithm For any language, it is indeed necessary to understand the code before its execution. Thus, start actualizing the need for every code you are using in the program right from the beginning, which in turn will build up your confidence while writing complex programs. It has been witnessed that even experts who have years of experience split the whole program into smaller portions to solve them. Memory allocation This point has been mentioned for the developers who are changing their domain from C or C++ to Java. As the former language doesn't consist of this feature. For further information related to Java do enroll yourself into our Java Training in Anna Nagar. DevOps tools knowledge Tools knowledge will be of great use during the execution of complicated programs. Thus, get a thorough knowledge of it from the experts from the industry. Create only useful objects It is to be kept in mind that whatever object you create it must be useful as they are memory consumers along with the speed. As the creation of any object is incomplete until memory allocation is completed. Thus, it will be better if you cross-check the object requirements before its creation. Interface better than Abstract class Multiple inheritances are absent in Java make sure you remember this throughout your career as this may have set-back in your life. When compared with the Abstract class, the interface allows the user to have numerous methods to work. The standard library added advantage Java has blurred many languages that came into existence before it. This is due to the set of standard library which is present in abundance. These library methods make the work of the developer simpler in an organized manner. Moreover, the accomplishment of tasks is presented in a simplified manner. Primitive classes prefer over Wrapper class A wrapper class is of great service and primitive class is comparatively slower as they only have the value whereas the former can store information. Wrapper class consists of object value whereas primitive class won't dish out the expected results. Deal with Strings Object-oriented programming categorizes string as a class that affects both the memory and speed of any system. Hence, you must be aware of the usage of string in Java. Get the in-depth knowledge in Java from experts by joining our Java Training in Velachery. Learn Latest version of Java at FITA Even after 5 years from the launch still its usage has not been reduced due to its one-line code features such as lambdas and stream API. The launch of Java 9, 10, 11 didn't affect much. Besides, Java 12 which was launched in March 2019 has various features to negate the shortcomings in previous versions.
