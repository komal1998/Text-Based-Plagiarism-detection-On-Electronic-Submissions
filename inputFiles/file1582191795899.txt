Currently, no doubt it is Oracle Certified Master certification, which is most valued because it is also the toughest to get. Even if you have 10 years of Java experienced, it’s hard to crack this exam, and hence it’s valued a lot. If you want to become a Java architect or solution architect, this is the exam, which you need to clear. Since, many developers take the certification to get Job, when it comes to popularity, i.e. the certification which most of Java developer give then certainly OCPJP and OCAJP scores big. How many questions are on JAVA exams? There are different number of questions for different Java Exams. For example- 1Z0-808 exam (Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 8 Programmer) has 70 questions, and 1Z0-897 exam (Oracle Certified Expert, Java EE 6 Web Services Developer) has 55 questions. All candidates get the same Java exam questions in order to make a fair comparison between them. If participants were given different questions, there would be no way of making sure that each individual test is of the same difficulty. However, the order of the questions & answers in the test is shuffled for each test. How much does JAVA certification cost? It costs 10100 INR for both the exams each programmer I and programmer II, but you can get some discount by paying directly at the test center. So it’s up to you, you can either buy an exam voucher online for 10100, or you can pay 8700 at the test center(Cost may vary). Please check is your voucher includes retake(in case you fail). What is the passing score for JAVA certification? Oracle’s Java Certification has a tough passing percentage, close to 65% for both OCPJP (The Oracle Certified Professional Java Programmer) and OCAJP (The Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer). You need in-depth knowledge of the Java Programming language and APIs to succeed in the exam. How long is JAVA certification valid? The certifications are valid for their versions. For example, if you succeeded in the Java 6 exam, then your certification is valid as long as you live only for that version of the technology. You cannot claim that as the Java 8 certification. Does JAVA certification expire? Certifications do not expire. Once you are certified, you keep that certification. So once you are OCAJP8 certified, you will always be OCAJP8 certified. But Oracle can retire certification exams. As long as the certification exists, there is no expiry for the certifications. For example, if you are writing for OCJP 6, then it is valid for only the Java 6 version. When Oracle discontinues the OCJP 6, your certification doesn’t hold any value for the latest certifications. What is the salary for a JAVA Certified Professional? According to PayScale, the average salary for a Java developer is $69,722 pa, with an average salary range of $47,169 to $106,610 pa.

This programming language is known as one of the best platforms for mobile application developers. Java has two strategic domains known as Core Java and Advance Java. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from mobile phones and embedded devices to supercomputers and enterprise servers. It is the most popular programming language for Client-Server applications with more than 10 million developers worldwide. Core Java training in Chennai helps to build an applet or small application modules to make it possible for a Web page user to interact with the page. The Java course helps to get opportunities to work in a cross-platform computing environment What is Java? Java is a programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems. Java is a simple, portable, platform-independent, object-oriented, multi-threaded, secure, architecture-neutral, robust, high performance, dynamic and distributed. It runs on various OS platforms like Mac, Windows, and UNIX. It can be used to develop software and applets. What is the full meaning of Java? JAVA (Just Another Virtual Accelerator) being used as slang for “coffee” Java does not have any full form, but a programming language originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Micro systems in 1995, which has since been taken by Oracle Corporation. It derives much of its syntax from the most popular programming languages of all time: C & C++. What type of language is Java? Java is an object-oriented language. Its syntax is common as C & C++. Java programs are compiled to class files (bytecode) that can run on any JVM (Java Virtual Machine), making Java a platform-independent programming language. It does not require re-compilation and works efficiently in computers as well as Android mobile platforms. Why is Java a platform? Java is a platform for application development. A platform is a loosely defined computer industry buzzword that typically means some combination of system hardware & software that will mostly run all the same software. For example, DEC Alphas running Windows NT would be one platform, Power Macs running Mac OS 9.2 would be another. What is Java used for? In today’s world, Java has a wide variety of different uses. For example, Java is used for web-applications like Google docs and also for things like mobile games. Perhaps most notably, Java is mostly used to build applets or small application modules for use as part of a web page. Java can be used to code almost anything. It is often used as a “backend” programming language for the web, so web applications will often use Java code to create Application Program Interface (API) to allow the front-end to do different tasks. What is the difference between Java and core Java? Java is a programming language, but Core Java is a part of Java. Core Java is the basic of Java. If you don’t know anything about Java, then you have to start with core Java. Core Java is used for developing a general Java application whereas Advanced Java is used for developing the web-based application and enterprise application. Core Java is having the concept of Java fundamentals, JDBC, Swings, Applet, Java Beans technology without this; no one can jump on any advance Java technology. Java is basically categorized in 3 parts: J2EE, J2SE and J2ME. To learn J2ME or J2EE, you should know core Java. What is the difference between Java and Javascript? JavaScript (JS) is not related to or similar to Java. JS is an OOP scripting language while Java is an OOP programming language. Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine(VM) or browser while JS code is run on a browser only. Java code needs to be compiled, whereas JavaScript code is all in the text. Both languages have a C like a syntax and are mostly used in client-side Web applications, but there are few similarities only. Is Java an open-source? In 2006, Sun released much of Java as FOSS (free and open-source software), under the terms of the GNU GPL (General Public License). In 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java’s core code available under a free software or open-source distribution terms, apart from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright. Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) is an open-source and free implementation of the Java programming language. Is Java a coffee? Java logo is a coffee-cup because “Java” is a slang term for “coffee”. Many Java software products contain coffee-related puns (e.g. numerous variants of “espresso”). Gosling wanted a simple but an attractive name for his product. It was named oak at first; later it was changed to Java. What is j2ee in Java? J2EE in Java stands for Java 2 Enterprise Edition. J2EE is a Java-centric, platform-independent environment from Sun for developing, building & deploying Web-based enterprise applications online. The J2EE platform consists of a set of APIs, services, and protocols that provide the functionality for developing multitiered, Web-based applications. What are the Applications/domains using Java Technology? Java is an amazing technology with applications in several fields from Android applications, server apps at financial services industry, software tools to trading applications. Here is a list of applications of Java: Web front-end development (Applets) Web back-end development (Servlets) Standalone windows based desktop Applications (GUI programming) Networking (Socket programming) Database based (accessing) applications (JDBC) Big Data (Hadoop) Mobile applications (Android) AI applications Embedded Systems Applications for Big Enterprises Games programming Placement Assistance after JAVA Training With years of experience in training, Besant technologies have a large client base, and we constantly get requirements for providing good resources.
